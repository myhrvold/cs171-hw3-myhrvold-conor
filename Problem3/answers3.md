1. Name the HTML element (type and class) that represents the interactive area.

rect class="extent"

2. Name the HTML element (type and class) that is used for representing the selection.

rect class="background"

3. What are the other DOM elements for?

The other DOM elements appear to be for resizing the brush rectangle itself, i.e. transalting the width (since height is fixed) to what it's representing on the large detailed section.
