For my difference map, I initially wanted to represent the variance of the estimates by highlighting the area in which the estimates resides, i.e. at a given year the space between the upper estimate and lower estimate would be filled in. However, looking at the data there was substantially little *relative* variation between the estimates compared to their overall magnitude. So I had to go back to the drawing board a bit and combine elements from my planned visualization, with some ideas that I initially rejected, from my design studio partners.

While I liked my problem two implementation, were several things I thought could be improved:
- Since there were five estimates and interpolation lines...there were in essence five stories being told. Which is fine from an estimate method standpoint, but the overall visualization I wanted to convey was ultimately one of human population growth. I think this is a more powerful story than "what's the variation between population estimates". (Answer -- relatively minimal! :-p) So I wanted to have one interpolation line which ran through the middle of the estimates.
- The color scheme visually helped distinguish different estimates but didn't add any extra information. The one story I wanted to be told was that of population increase, so besides increasing the y axis so more of this population increase could be seen, I created a heat scale from blue to red and made the keys the 5 estimates. So the lowball estimate was blue, then purple, then dark red, to light red as the highest population estimate. This became my distinguishing factor instad of different colored interpolation lines.
- Finally, most of the population increase has happened since the advent of the Industrial Era, in the last several hundred years. While seeing such an exponential increase from 0 AD certainly looks dramatic, I wanted to focus on recent continued growth so examined 1950-2050 (I accomplished this by slicing the data in JavaScript, but the effort of recreating the data structure which I parsed in took away too much from my real focus, which was on making the visualization.)
